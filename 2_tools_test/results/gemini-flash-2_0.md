Twinkle, twinkle, current date,
It is February sixth, straight.
Twinkle, twinkle, stock so high,
NVIDIA's at one twenty-nigh.

Twinkle, twinkle, chilly air,
Thirty seven degrees to bear.
Twinkle, twinkle, squared so grand
Thirteen sixty-nine, understand?

Twinkle, twinkle, Elon's name,
Democrats call, within the game.
Twinkle, twinkle, news so bright,
Shining through the day and night.

Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are.
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.
