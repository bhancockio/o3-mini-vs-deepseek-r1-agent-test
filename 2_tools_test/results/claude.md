Title: "Data Data Tell A Tale"
(Sung to the tune of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star")

Verse 1:
Data, data, tell a tale,
On this day, let's lift the veil,
February fifth is here,
Twenty twenty-five is clear,
Like a story to be told,
Let these numbers now unfold.

Verse 2:
Sixty-eight degrees today,
Makes New York feel warm, they say,
Square it up to forty-six,
Twenty-four, math does its tricks,
Temperature is quite a sight,
Making winter feel just right.

Verse 3:
NVIDIA stocks do shine,
One-twenty-four point eight-three, so fine,
Up and down the market goes,
Like a dance that each day shows,
Traders watching with delight,
As the numbers take their flight.

Verse 4:
Elon Musk is in the news,
Government plans he does peruse,
Working hours, changes bold,
Stories daily do unfold,
Making headlines every day,
As he charts his special way.

Final Verse:
Data, data, now we're done,
Numbers tell what life has spun,
Weather, stocks, and current things,
Show the tale each morning brings,
Like the stars up in the night,
Data makes our world so bright.
