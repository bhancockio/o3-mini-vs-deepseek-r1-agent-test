(Tune: Twinkle Twinkle Little Star)

Verse 1:
Twinkle, twinkle, little date,
On this day, it's quite great,
It's February three, twenty-twenty-five,
The world's events, they are alive,
Twinkle, twinkle, what’s to say,
When the world spins every day.

Verse 2:
Weather, weather, in New York,
Sixty-one degrees, no need for a fork,
Warm and breezy, so divine,
As the temperature does align,
Weather, weather, in the sky,
Feel the season gently fly.

Verse 3:
Stock price, stock price, NVIDIA's climb,
One sixteen sixty-six, what a time,
Technology rises, reaching high,
In the market, it does fly,
Stock price, stock price, soaring moon,
May it keep its steady tune.

Verse 4:
Elon, Elon, in the news,
Making headlines, never to lose,
Plans with government, oh so bold,
Stories of his actions told,
Elon, Elon, mastermind,
Leaving no great thought behind.

Verse 5:
Square the temp and see it's true,
Thirty-seven twenty-one, a new view,
Mathematics plays its role,
In the universe, it folds,
Twinkle, twinkle, numbers bright,
Giving knowledge, guiding light. 

Chorus:
Twinkle, twinkle, here we sing,
Of the world's constant spring,
From the news to market's way,
Join us in a twinkling play,
Twinkle, twinkle, stars ignite,
In the data’s sparkling light.
