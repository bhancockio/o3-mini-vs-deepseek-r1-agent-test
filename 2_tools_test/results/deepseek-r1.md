(Tune of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star")  

**Verse 1**  
Twinkle, twinkle, winter's day,  
Sixty-eight degrees in NY!  
February third, skies so bright,  
Warmth above the city lights.  
Twinkle, twinkle, winter's day,  
Data paints the Milky Way.  

**Verse 2**  
NVIDIA shines in the blue,  
Nine fifty dollars, bold and true.  
Chips and dreams mount cosmic heights,  
Guiding AI’s future flights.  
NVIDIA shines in the blue,  
Tech’s bright star in midnight hue.  

**Verse 3**  
Elon’s rockets race to Mars,  
Breaking through celestial bars.  
Crewed ships sail the starlit sea,  
Mars mission’s new galaxy!  
Elon’s rockets race to Mars,  
Science writes its memoirs.  

**Verse 4**  
Four six two four, squared with cheer,  
Math’s warm spark to Northern Bear.  
Numbers hum a lullaby,  
Sixty-eight kissed by the sky.  
Four six two four, squared with cheer,  
Data-star, we’re gathered here!  

**Outro**  
Twinkle, data’s cosmic rhyme,  
Stocks and rockets, space and time.  
Warmth and pixels, humans strive—  
To make this *star* feel most alive.  
Twinkle, data’s cosmic rhyme,  
Sing with me: “The *now*’s sublime!”
