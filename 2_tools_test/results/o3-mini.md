Twinkle, twinkle, date so bright,  
2025-02-03 lights up the night.  
Glistening stars above so high,  
Marking moments as time goes by.

Twinkle, twinkle, weather fair,  
Sixty-one degrees fills the air.  
Square that warmth to 3721,  
A magic number like the sun.

Twinkle, twinkle, stocks that gleam,  
NVIDIA shines at 116.66 it seems.  
In the sky of markets, bold and clear,  
A steady guide we revere.

Twinkle, twinkle, news so grand,  
Elon Muskâ€™s headlines across the land.  
Bold moves and stories ever-new,  
In a world where dreams come true.

Twinkle, twinkle, merge them all,  
Data, stars, and tales that call.  
A song of numbers and cosmic art,  
Illuminating each curious heart.
